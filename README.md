# JWNotifyer
Custom app to receive notification when new content is available on JW.ORG

The project is scheduled to be completed by the end of June 2022.
Thank you for your interest and expectation.

## The future of the application?

If this one is used, a version 2 will be made available as soon as possible. But what changes will it bring?

For the moment, the application just uses a service that runs in the background to check if new content is available. It works but it's clearly not ideal given the power consumption it can give on many devices. The solution would be to centralize the searches on a server and use push notifications from the server.

If you are interested in this solution, please let me know.

### Notice: 

Not being in possession of a MacOS device, I will not be in a position to compile the iOS application. So I am looking for someone who can do it for me when the development is finished.
